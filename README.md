# DesignVerse

*[中文](README.zh.md)*

## Project Overview

DesignVerse is an interactive repository showcasing contemporary design styles, created to help designers, developers, and enthusiasts understand the characteristics, applications, and implementation methods of different design movements. Each style is demonstrated through actual web design examples using the same content structure but different visual languages.

## Features

- **Diverse Design Styles**: Includes multiple popular design styles, from classic Swiss International Style to modern Glassmorphism
- **Consistent Content Structure**: All design style pages present identical content, facilitating intuitive comparison of visual expression differences
- **Responsive Design**: All pages adapt to different device sizes
- **Code Implementation**: Each design style has complete HTML and CSS implementation for learning reference
- **Scalability**: The project architecture supports continuous addition of new design styles

## Included Design Styles

The project currently includes the following design styles:

1. **TheVerge Style** - Tech media website style with dark backgrounds and neon highlights
2. **Swiss/International Style** - Modern design approach focusing on clarity and objectivity
3. **Cyberpunk Style** - Futuristic dystopian aesthetics with neon effects
4. **Glassmorphism** - Semi-transparent frosted glass effects for depth
5. **Brutalist Style** - Minimalistic digital expression with raw aesthetics
6. **Vaporwave Style** - 80s-90s nostalgic elements with retro computing aesthetics
7. **Material Design** - Google's design language based on paper and ink metaphors
8. **Neumorphism** - Soft UI effects creating an extruded appearance
9. **Anti-Design** - Challenging traditional aesthetic rules with experimental approaches
10. **Minimalism** - Focusing on essential elements with generous whitespace
